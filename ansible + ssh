# Generate an SSH key pair: If you haven't already, generate an SSH key pair on the Ansible control node using the ssh-keygen command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# Copy the public key to the remote hosts: You'll need to copy the public key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to each of the remote hosts within the specified range. 
# You can use a tool like ssh-copy-id or manually append the public key to the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file on each remote host.
ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remote_user@192.168.0.100
# Repeat this step for each host in the range, replacing the IP address accordingly.

# Check for Existing SSH Keys:
ls -l ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# Alternatively, Check All Key Files:
ls ~/.ssh/

# Using Git Bash
ls -l ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# For Windows 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 (firefox recommend)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
ssh-copy-id root@192.168.0.102

# Windows
dir $HOME\.ssh\id_rsa* 
# If the files id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key) exist, then an SSH key pair is already present.





# Configure Ansible inventory: In your Ansible inventory file (e.g., hosts or inventory), define the hosts within the specified range. You can use the IP address range notation like this:
[webservers]
192.168.0.100-110
