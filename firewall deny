# If you want to apply NAT to your iptables, depending on whether you want to apply it to incoming connections or outgoing connection, 
# or whether your computer’s IP address is static or dynamic, you can use the following rules.
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 22 --destination 192.168.40.40 -j DNAT --to-destination 123.123.123.123:4040
# After the above command, every outgoing traffic from your computer heading to IP address 192.168.40.40 port 22 will be sent to IP address 123.123.123.123 port 4040. 
# This makes it possible for a NAT in the destination network to be accessible from outside that network.
