# ubuntu server

apt install openssh-server

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  Here are some common settings you might want to adjust:
  PermitRootLogin no (Disallow root login over SSH for security reasons)
  PasswordAuthentication yes (Allow password-based authentication, or change to no to use key-based authentication only)
  Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server (Enables the SFTP subsystem)
  After making changes, save and exit the file.

systemctl restart sshd

adduser newuser

#Configure Firewall (if enabled)
ufw allow ssh

sftp user@server_ip

# linux client
sftp username@server_address

# windows client

4. In FileZilla, go to "File > Site Manager" and create a new site with the server details.
5. Connect to the SFTP server, and you should see the remote directory structure.
