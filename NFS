# client windows
1. Download and install "Windows Services for NFS" from Microsoft's website.
2. After installation, open the "NFS Client" from the Start menu or run nfsadmin.
3. In the NFS Client, click "Create a new NFS Mounting..." and enter the details of your NFS server (IP address and share path).
4. Choose a local drive letter to mount the NFS share.
5. The NFS share will now be accessible as a drive letter on your Windows machine.

# client iMac
To use your iMac as an NFS client to access NFS shares, follow these steps:
1. Enable NFS Client Service on your iMac:
  Go to System Preferences > Sharing.
  Check the box next to "Remote Login" to enable the Remote Login service.
2. Create a directory to mount the NFS share:
  Open Terminal on your iMac.
  Create a new directory where you want to mount the NFS share
mkdir /Volumes/nfs_share

3. Mount the NFS share:
  In Terminal, use the mount command to mount the NFS share:
mount -t nfs -o resvport 192.168.0.110:/web/shr /Volumes/nfs_share

4. Enter your administrator password when prompted.
5. Verify the mount:
  After entering your password, the NFS share should be mounted.
  Verify this by running
df -h

6. Access the NFS share:
  The NFS share is now accessible through the /Volumes/nfs_share directory (or the directory you specified in step 2).
  You can navigate to this directory in the Finder or use it in Terminal commands.
7. To unmount the NFS share, use the umount command:
sudo umount /Volumes/nfs_share

Optionally, you can also set up automatic mounting of the NFS share at boot time by editing the /etc/auto_master and /etc/auto_share files.
However, this process is more advanced and requires careful configuration.
