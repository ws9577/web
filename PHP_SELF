# The $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] is a super global variable that returns the filename of the currently executing script.
# Warning! The $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] variable can be used by hackers!
# If PHP_SELF is used in your page then a user can enter a slash / and then some Cross Site Scripting (XSS) commands to execute.

# Assume we have the following form in a page named "test_form.php":
<form method="post" action="<?php echo $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"];?>">

# Now, if a user enters the normal URL in the address bar like "http://www.example.com/test_form.php", the above code will be translated to:
<form method="post" action="test_form.php">

# However, consider that a user enters the following URL in the address bar:
http://www.example.com/test_form.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('hacked')%3C/script%3E
# In this case, the above code will be translated to:
<form method="post" action="test_form.php/"><script>alert('hacked')</script>
# This code adds a script tag and an alert command. And when the page loads, the JavaScript code will be executed (the user will see an alert box). This is just a simple and harmless example how the PHP_SELF variable can be exploited.
# Be aware of that any JavaScript code can be added inside the <script> tag! 
# A hacker can redirect the user to a file on another server, and that file can hold malicious code that can alter the global variables or submit the form to another address to save the user data, for example.

# How To Avoid $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] Exploits?
# $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] exploits can be avoided by using the htmlspecialchars() function.
# The form code should look like this:
<form method="post" action="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]);?>">
# The htmlspecialchars() function converts special characters to HTML entities. Now if the user tries to exploit the PHP_SELF variable, it will result in the following output:
<form method="post" action="test_form.php/&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert('hacked')&lt;/script&gt;">
# The exploit attempt fails, and no harm is done!
